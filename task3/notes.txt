I failed at an implementation of branch and bound because my search space was all possible strings. Which gives a search space of
alphabet_size ** string_length = 5 ** 70 = 10 ** 48
But i should have used different alignment indexes, which would have given me a search space of
length ** lines = 50 ** 1000000 = omfg large
