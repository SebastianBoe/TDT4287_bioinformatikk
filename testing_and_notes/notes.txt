What non-brute force algorithm solves task 2?

Go through each slide in the algorithm.
Write down a report from each slide of the potential algorithms.

Introduction:
NO - Longest common subsequence - Given the longest common subsequence, doesn't help you with a prefix-suffix match.
NO - Dynamic Programming - Cannot conceive of an optimal subproblem property.

Alignment:
Just Dynamic Programming again.

Heuristic Alignment / statistical analysis:
Hmm, k-mer dot plots looks interesting.
No, it is not. It is not faster than brute force.

Hmm, l-mer filtration looks interesting.
Nope, hopeless.
